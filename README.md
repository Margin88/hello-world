# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

Hi everyone!

Margin here. I'm a assistant research fellow at CAS.
I'm focused on auditory perception, psychoacoustics and CAEP research. And also software development on hearing test, Speech assessment, speech rehabilitation, mHealth and so on.

Nice meeting you in the GitHub world.
